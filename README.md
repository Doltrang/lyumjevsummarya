## README.md
The website <a href="https://petervanrijt.github.io/lyumjevsummary/">https://petervanrijt.github.io/lyumjevsummary/</a> is part of <a href="https://petervanrijt.nl/category/diabetes/" target="_blank">my blog series</a>. I do not have – and do not want – any sponsorship deals or whatsoever and pay for all equipment just like anybody else. 

For quite some time, I have been reading on Lyumjev and looping. Last week we started with using Lyumjev ourselves. On this website I have summarized all suggestions I have read online. Creating it took me quite some time, with several months in preparation by reading and saving links.

What is Lyumjev? This translated quote from <a href="https://www.diabetestype1.nl/gesprekken/behandeling/718-wanneer-mogen-we-eindelijk-eens-lyumjev-insuline-gaan-gebruiken-in-nederland" target="_blank">this article on diabetestype1.nl</a> describes: "_Lyumjev is an ultra-fast-acting insulin (a so-called URLi - Ultra-rapid lispro), which works faster than e.g. Humalog or Novorapid, and even faster than Fiasp. This insulin can better combat glucose peaks after a meal (...)_". 

The shorter peak time of <a href="https://androidaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Configuration/Config-Builder.html#lyumjev" target="_blank">45 minutes with Lyumjev</a>, compared to <a href="https://androidaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Configuration/Config-Builder.html#rapid-acting-oref" target="_blank">75 minutes (Humalog, Novolog, Novorapid)</a> and <a href="https://androidaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Configuration/Config-Builder.html#ultra-rapid-oref" target="_blank">55 minutes (FIASP)</a>, seems small but is a significant difference in using all available automation in (do-it-yourself) closed loops systems. See <a href="#2-lowering-the-mental-burden">chapter 2</a> for a look into the future and what can already be achieved with do-it-yourself closed loop systems!

I am convinced it is a waste of resources when everybody does the same and asks the same questions on the do-it-yourself Facebook groups. When everybody provides feedback on this summary, (new) users can improve faster with fewer basic questions, and therefore have more time to improve their personal settings. 

Information in this presentation is found online, which has been shared by the online do-it-yourself community. See <a href="#7-overview-of-partly-used-sources">chapter 7 for an overview of all (partly) used sources</a>. I want to give a BIG THANK YOU to all volunteers and medical professionals contributing to this new do-it-yourself treatment of diabetes.

I am Peter, a millennial born in 1984, living in The Netherlands, and I hope someone will find a cure for type 1 diabetes (T1D) fast. Since my girlfriend got the T1D-diagnose, both of our lives have rapidly changed. I became involved as a volunteer on the AndroidAPS project. 

I commit my IT Service Delivery Management passion to a more comfortable and healthier diabetes life because of all automation possible since 2013. As a professional, I feel comfortable delivering value, overseeing all components while managing staff and costs.

All the best, 
Peter #wearenotwaiting #payitforward
